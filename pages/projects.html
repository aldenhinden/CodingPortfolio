        <details>
            <summary><b>Distributed System:</b> Java Non-Relational Database Similar to Amazon’s DynamoDB or
                Google’s Spanner</summary><br>
            <p>
                The quarter-long goal of this project was to build a sharded, linearizable, scalable, fault-tolerant,
                highly available key-value store, with dynamic load balancing and atomic multi-key transactions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project was primarily written in Java, beginning with the creation of a personalized key-value store. Fault
                tolerance was attempted first with a primary/backup system, wherein two servers act together to
                guarantee no state is lost or altered from the client's perspective. The client talks to the primary,
                who executes after the backup has processed the request as well. The servers interact with a ViewServer
                who tells them who is primary and who is backup at any given time. Linearizability was guaranteed through "exactly
                once" semantics, where clients would retry requests on timers and servers use cached results for already executed
                requests.
            </p>
            <div class="flex-container">
                <p>
                    To guarantee linearizability of commands in the event that the ViewServer goes down, a Paxos protocol
                    was then implemented. The version implemented in class was adapted from <a href="https://paxos.systems/">this</a>
                    paper. In general, clients send requests to all replicas, of which only the leader of the Paxos group processes,
                    then broadcasting the request to all other replicas for consensus. Consensus is reached by way of replicas voting
                    for which client's command should be placed into their log of commands. Once consensus on the order of commands has
                    been reached, the leader processes the requests by moving through its log and executing consecutive slots that have
                    been chosen by the replicas and replies to the client after each execution. The replicas will do the same, all storing
                    commands in their own log which is updated by the leader through heartbeat messages. Servers communicate through
                    a series of messages that each contain their own functionality, and timers are used to solve network latency issues,
                    including message delays, reorders, and drops. "Exactly once" semantics and linearizable consistency are still guaranteed.
                    In the event that a leader is not currently active or network latency issues have caused partitioning on
                    the network such that the replicas are unaware of a current leader, the replicas will undergo an election process to
                    become the new leader. Leaders are elected with a majority of votes from the total number of servers in the system,
                    and partitions are resolved by prioritizing higher ballot numbers, which monotonically increase throughout the system's life.
                </p>
                <img src="../docs/ds/pmmc.png" alt="Paxos made moderately complex, algorithm flow chart" class="pmmc">
            </div>
            <p>
                Linearizability as well as fault tolerance for network latency issues including message delays, reorders, and drops are
                primarily solved using the Paxos protocol. Scalability is then addressed by creating a transactional key-value store that
                can handle sets of client requests, while the keys are sharded across the servers using consistent virtual hashing.
                A ShardMaster manages a sequence of numbered configurations describing a set of replica groups and an assignment of
                shards. Each replica group runs the previously implemented Paxos protocol to guarantee linearizability of commands.
                To help guarantee high availability, the ShardMaster will dynamically load balance the store, determining if a new
                configuration is necessary and redistributing shards to new groups as they come and go or as keys become more popular.
                Lastly, transactions are processed using a two-phase commit strategy so that commands can be executed across shard groups.
                When a transaction is received, a coordinator uses prepare and commit messages to ask replicas if they can
                commit to this transaction and then execute its set of commands respectively. This allows the distributed system to
                handle increasingly high numbers of client requests. The result is a scalable, highly available, linearizable,
                fault-tolerant database.

            <summary><b>ReWrite:</b> ChatGPT Integrated PDF Summarizer</summary><br>
            <p>
                Full stack development on a team integrating the ChatGPT API into an Angular CLI website, using prompt engineering
                and JavaScript web scraping to return summaries of uploaded PDFs. Experience configuring a virtual private server
                to fully deploy the website using <a href="https://www.vultr.com/">Vultr</a>'s high performance cloud servers.
                Continuous integration and testing experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                The primary intended use case for this product was to provide users with the ability to summarize complex research
                papers easily. The user visits our website, navigates to the "translate" page, and clicks "upload", providing a PDF
                which they wish to have summarized (note: they must also provide their own API key from OpenAI in the class version).
                They have the option to choose a "quick" translation or a "deep" translation, which will make calls to the ChatGPT API
                either in parallel or sequentially, respectively.
            </p>
            <img src="../docs/rewrite/rewrite.png" alt="ReWrite translate page" class="rewrite">
            <p>
                The website front end was developed using the Angular CLI framework. Uploaded PDFs are scraped using the pdf-parse
                package from Node.js, and the output string is thereafter sent to simplification. After a prompt describing to ChatGPT
                how to summarize is made, the text is broken up into chunks before being sent to ChatGPT through API calls (if "quick"
                mode is enabled, these calls are made in parallel). ChatGPT processes the text chunk-by-chunk before sending the
                result back to the front end. The front end and back end communicate through their respective servers. Continuous
                integration is set up through the Node.js by GitHub Actions using Mocha tests and the Chai testing framework. The
                website was deployed using <a href="https://www.vultr.com/">Vultr</a> to create both a development and production
                version of the website.

                Full implementation of Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the shortest path between buildings on UW campus using a
                personalized, generic graph data structure in Java. Front-end UI integration with HTML and ReactJS. Practice

            <p>
                From the user's perspective, the front end displays a map of the UW campus alongside two drop down menus displaying
                lists of buildings. The user can select a starting point and an ending point, and the UI will display the shortest
                path between those two locations using a purple line.
            </p>
            <p>
                The buildings are read from a CSV file into the generic graph data structure. The <code>Graph&ltN, E&gt</code> is a
                wrapper around a <code>HashMap&ltNode&ltN&gt, HashSet&ltEdge&ltE, N&gt&gt&gt</code> and supports the following
                functions: <code>addNode(N label), addEdge(E label, N source, N dest), getNodeList(), getEdgeSet(N parent),
                getParents(N node), getChildren(N node), hasNode(Object o), hasEdge(E label, N source, N dest)</code>. Once the
                buildings are read from CSV file, a graph is constructed mapping building names to their Double coordinates. That
                graph is then sent to the following function that computes the shortest path between two points using Dijkstra's

                Given a working PacMan game in Python, with each frame of the game representing a given "state", I was
                able to optimize PacMan's ability to reach a target position on a monster-less board. Beginning with
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search">Depth-First Search</a>, PacMan would
                search a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)">tree</a> of possible next moves,
                and choose the most desirable one. Although accurate, DFS is quickly optimized with
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search">Breadth-First Search</a> as
                an optimal DFS result would most likely be a random outlier given the nature of a maze. In turn,
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm#Practical_optimizations_and_infinite_graphs">Uniform-Cost Search</a>
                improves upon BFS by reducing the search space by taking into account the cost of the path, rather than
                exploring all states level-by-level in the search tree. Various heuristics such as
                <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_distance">Manhattan distance</a> were then added to
                optimize PacMan's ability to reach its goal efficiently using

                In order to further reduce the search space on complex mazes, starting to include those with ghost
                adversaries, PacMan was programmed to use
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning">Alpha-Beta Pruning</a> in order to
                more quickly decide which move would lead him towards success or certain death by discarding
                any verifiably suboptimal branches of the tree, thereby reducing the search space. I began experimenting
                with various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_function">evaluation functions</a> in
                order to optimize PacMan's safe path through the treacherous maze towards success. The idea was to
                penalize moves on the search tree that brought PacMan closer to ghosts and reward it for those that
                ate food dots, necessitating a scoring system with the perfect balance between avoiding death and
                optimally eating all the dots.
            </p>
            <p>
                Solving mazes is all too easy for AI PacMan when it can see a search tree, though. The next step was to
                throw it into the maze all by itself to learn the world on its own. The goal was complete
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning">reinforcement learning</a>, and I started
                with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process">Markov Decision Processes</a>,
                programming PacMan to iteratively update the values of states based on the expected rewards and transition
                probabilities associated with the actions it can take in each state. Beginning with the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman_equation">Bellman equation</a>, I ran
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process#Value_iteration">value iteration</a> in
                order to begin focusing PacMan on solely the Markovian present moment.

            <img src="../docs/pacman/valueiteration.png" alt="Value iteration equation." class="valueiteration">
            <p>
                Roughly summarized, the process described by the equation is to sum all the probabilities of the
                options for actions at a certain state (T), multiplied by the action you’re thinking of taking
                (the expected reward along the way, R) plus the discounted value of being there if you were to move
                there. Similarly, I also ran

                where PacMan focuses on improving the policy itself (the strategy that specifies the action the agent
                should take in each state to maximize its expected cumulative reward) rather than simply the value
                function. Asynchronous value iteration as well as prioritized sweeping were also implemented.

                Next up, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning">Q-learning</a> was implemented. In this
                version of reinforcement learning, PacMan ponders its MDP model to arrive at a complete policy before
                ever interacting with a real environment. When it does interact with the environment, it simply follows
                the precomputed policy. This contrasts value iteration, where PacMan does not actually learn from
                experience (not true reinforcement learning). PacMan was trained on hundreds of games, using an
                epsilon-greedy exploration strategy wherein it has to choose between exploiting the currently estimated
                best action (exploitation) and trying a new action that might yield a higher reward (exploration).
                Finally, PacMan could be placed into an unknown maze, without knowledge of the future, and due to its
                training and reinforcement learning, it understands how to act in its environment to most successfully
                solve the maze.

                The code for this project was written for the class CSE 473: Artificial Intelligence at UW. Please reach out
                to me via email at aldenhinden@gmail.com or aghs@cs.washington.edu for code as I would be happy to discuss this
                project further.

                        <b>Java Worklists and Tries:</b> A <code>Worklist</code> is an abstract data type that contains items
                        to be processed in some order. Implemented extensions of Worklists, including a
                        <code>ListFIFOQueue</code> (a linked list), <code>ArrayStack</code>, and
                        <code>CircularArrayFIFOQueue</code>. A <code>Trie</code> is set or dictionary which maps
                        "strings" to some type (think: more generic <code>Map</code>). Implemented extensions of Tries,
                        including <code>HashTrieMap</code> and <code>HashTrieSet</code>. Practice with the JUnit
                        testing framework to test these data structures.

                        <b>uMessage:</b> Wrote various data structures in Java to be the backing for an iMessage-like
                        messaging app. Data structures implemented include the following: <code>MinFourHeapComparable</code>,
                        an array based heap; <code>MoveToFrontList</code>, a linked list where new items are inserted at
                        the front of the list and an existing item gets moved to the front whenever it is referenced;
                        <code>AVLTree</code>, subclass of <code>BinarySearchTree</code> that does load balancing;
                        <code>ChainingHashTable</code>, a generic separate-chaining hash table. Also implemented Heap
                        Sort, Quick Sort, and TopK Sort sorting algorithms to be used with the data structures.
