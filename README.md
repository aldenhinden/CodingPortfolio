Alden's sample project experience from the UW Paul Allen School of Computer Science. 

---

### Campus Map
Full implementation of Dijkstra’s algorithm to find shortest path between buildings on UW campus using a personalized, generic graph data structure in Java. Front-end UI integration with HTML and ReactJS. Practice with simple HTTP servers in Java.

### G333gle
Created LinkedList and HashMap data structures in C to integrate with C++ index file to serve as back-end of a simple word-matching “mini Google”. Practice with C/C++ HTTP server implementation.

### PacMan Search
Optimizing maze pathfinding in Python with BFS, DFS, UCS, A* search, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and practice with evaluation functions. Further exploration into reinforcement learning with value iteration, Epsilon Greedy, Q-learning, and particle filtering

### Census Map
Practice with Java’s ForkJoinPool framework, using parallelism to compute query responses on a US population map.
