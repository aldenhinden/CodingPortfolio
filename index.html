            Hello! My name is Alden Hinden-Stevenson. I am an enthusiastic coder, recently graduated from the
            <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/">UW Paul Allen School of Computer Science</a> with a bachelor's
            degree in Computer Science. My interests include but are not limited to: algorithms, distributed
            systems/networking, data science, and software development. Please check out some of my sample
            works while I was a student!
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of academia, my favorite activities are surfing, snowboarding, soccer, guitar, and enjoying the
            natural world. Born in the Bronx, NY, I grew up on the small island of Vashon,
            located between Seattle and Tacoma. I have always had a soft spot for animals of all kinds, growing up with
            cats, miniature horses, chickens, and occasionally goats! My mother's dedication to her non-profit,
            <a href="https://vashonwilderness.org/">Vashon Wilderness Program</a>, alongside having participated
            and apprenticed with the program for give-or-take my entire childhood, has given me a great appreciation
            for nature connectedness. My father's dedication to his neuroscience work followed by his integration of data
            science with neurology and radiology tangentially inspired me to pursue a career in software engineering
            and Computer Science.
